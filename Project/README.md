## Problems Faced in Project ##

We have a lot of problems with our project because we have to use many libraries and learn how these libraries work in order to win the competition. Since we are implementing linear and logistic regression for the first time, there are some issues during the implementation. Problems can also occur when applying  data cleaning to  data frames. Also, when using the KFold method, there is the problem of checking the accuracy of the model used.
